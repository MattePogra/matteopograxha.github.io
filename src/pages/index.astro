				<span class="text-link">From Virality to Visibility: How Social Media Shapes Television Coverage of Politicians</span> - Job Market Paper (New draft coming soon!)
				<!-- Abstract Section -->
				<p class="mt-2 ml-4 text-[0.75rem]">
					I examine whether social media virality helps politicians secure television airtime, with online success signaling political relevance to television producers. Using comprehensive X data from all Italian Members of the Parliament linked to their daily television airtime, I develop a classification of extreme rhetoric that undermines democratic norms through institutional delegitimization, group-based discrimination, and zero-sum framing. I first show that extreme rhetoric creates strong incentives for politicians by substantially increasing online engagement and the probability of going viral. I then document a clear feedback mechanism between platforms: politicians who achieve viral status receive significantly more television invitations the following day, secure greater speaking time when invited, and receive invitations from more programs. To explain these patterns, I develop a theoretical model where politicians strategically choose extreme rhetoric to exploit online attention dynamics, even when audiences correctly discount the exaggeration. The findings reveal how social media has created new pathways for politicians to convert online attention into traditional media airtime.

					Every day, editors of media outlets decide what is news and what is not. We unpack the process of news production by looking at the share of newscasts devoted to weather events by local TV stations in the United States. We document that coverage increases with the severity of the weather event that day. We also uncover that stations operating in Democratic-leaning markets devote more time to extreme weather events and mention climate change more than outlets in Republican-leaning markets. We make sense of these publication and presentation biases with a stylised model of news production and consumption.
