					Does going viral on social media buy access to television? This paper studies whether social media success serves as a bridge from low barrier platforms to television, a high barrier gatekeeping arena, where online engagement can serve as a timely signal for booking decisions. Using a dataset linking roughly 700,000 tweets by Italian Members of Parliament (MPs) from 2018 to 2022 to daily speaking time on major talk shows and newscasts, I implement an event study around days when an MP reaches the top 1% of engagement across all MP tweets. Viral MPs experience clear increases in next day television invitations, with effects concentrated on private channels, consistent with market driven gatekeeping. To understand what drives engagement, I then show that extreme rhetoric, defined as institutional delegitimization, group based discrimination, or zero sum framing, raises engagement and the probability of reaching the top 1% threshold. A supply side model of rhetorical exaggeration rationalizes these incentives: producers use virality as a noisy signal of audience interest, citizens discount exaggeration but engage expressively, and a single politician optimally exaggerates rhetoric to trade reputation for visibility.

					Every day, editors of media outlets decide what is news and what is not. We unpack the process of news
					production by looking at the share of newscasts devoted to weather events by local TV stations in the United States.
					Coverage increases with the severity of the weather event that day. Stations in Democratic leaning markets devote
					more time to extreme weather and mention climate change more than outlets in Republican leaning markets. We interpret
					these publication and presentation patterns with a stylised model of news production and consumption.

					Does confrontation on television attract more viewers? This paper studies whether heated debates draw larger audiences
					than respectful discussions, and whether spectacle driven formats impair citizen learning. We develop a framework using
					machine learning to extract debate intensity, namely interruptions, overlapping speech, and volume, from audio of Italian
					political talk shows, linking these features to minute by minute audience data. We implement a dynamic difference in
					differences design that exploits within episode variation in debate intensity to measure viewership responses. We plan to
					run a randomized experiment to test whether spectacle captures attention while reducing information retention.

					Central bank announcements generate vast social media discussions that reveal how markets interpret monetary policy.
					We assemble a dataset of over 125 million tweets surrounding ECB, Fed, and BoE policy decisions. Using AI based
					classification, we distinguish relevant tweets and categorize them as hawkish or dovish, constructing a real time
					measure of disagreement about future policy. Higher social media disagreement is strongly associated with larger
					financial market reactions following announcements, highlighting social media's value for understanding how central
					bank communication shapes expectations.
